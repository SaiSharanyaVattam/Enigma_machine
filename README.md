# Enigma_machine

The ENIGMA machine is an iconic cryptographic device that was used by the Germans during World War II to encrypt their communications. The machine used a series of rotors and a plugboard to scramble messages, making them nearly impossible to decipher without the correct settings. In this project, we aim to implement the ENIGMA machine on an FPGA platform.
To implement the ENIGMA machine on an FPGA, we used verilog hardware description language (HDL) to describe the hardware components of the machine. We then used a synthesis tool to generate the logic gates and routing of the design. Finally, we used a programming tool to configure the FPGA with the generated bitstream.
